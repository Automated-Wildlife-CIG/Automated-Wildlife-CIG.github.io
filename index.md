### About

***Our goal is to create new, inexpensive, standardized, open-source technology that can be used to monitor insect pollinators, reptiles and amphibians, and cavity nesting bird nests.***

### Team

#### Donald J Brightsmith
***PI, Associate Professor of Ecosystem Health, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University.***
Donald J Brightsmith has over 25 years of experience working with cavity nesting birds, including studies estimating reproductive success, abundance, and diversity. He has authored 67 peer-reviewed articles and directly managed over \$2,500,000 in research funding including as PI on NSF I-Corps (award 1634613) and PFI: AIR-TT (award 1701026). His NSF grants involved computer vision-based tracking of captive birds. Brightsmith’s lab group is also developing and deploying bird nest box based temperature, humidity and movement logging hardware. His group has informally collaborated with Doug Bonham for a Microsoft Hackathon project and has collaborated with Ethel Villalobos on bird and insect monitoring projects. Brightsmith will be the project lead, overseeing and coordinating all technical and financial aspects of the project. He will also be the lead biologist for the bird nest box section.


#### Chris Evelyn 

***Co-PI, PhD. UC Santa Barbara***
Dr. Chris Evelyn is in charge of the development, testing, and validation of the reptile and amphibian devices for this project. Dr. Evelyn is a Senior Museum Scientist UC Santa Barbara who specializes in herpetology and has conducted field research on the ranches in the California study area for more than 10 years. He has experience with all of the target species for this project and has conducted ecological research on amphibians and reptiles across California and Mexico, offering species identification expertise for training artificial intelligence on the images gathered by the proposed project. Dr. Evelyn’s master’s research explored non-traditional methods for the valuation and profitability of cattle ranches in Monterrey, California. He brings to the team knowledge of producer management for wildlife thanks to his identity as a ranchland herpetologist. Dr. Evelyn’s will function as the team GIS expert and ensure the team’s free GIS software tool works with USDA-preferred tools such as GIS Feature Services and Conservation Desktop. Dr. Evelyn served as Co-PI for a federal grant with the US Forest Service Region 5 (2016 Species of Conservation Concern and Sensitive Taxa List) and recently returned from a UC Mexus postdoctoral fellowship in Mexico.


#### Ethel Villalobos
***PhD., Jr. Researcher, Department of Plant and Environmental Protection Sciences, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawaii at Manoa***
Dr. Ethel Villalobos' expertise is ecology and behavior, having worked for over 30 years with insects, and in particular Hymenoptera. She is the lead researcher of the UH
Honeybee Project and has obtained and successfully managed over $2,000,000 in research funding from a variety of agencies including EPA, USDA-NIFA, NSF-LSAMP, as well as agricultural development grants from the Western Region agencies (WSARE, WIPM). The topics of her research range from applied systems such as fruit fly monitoring and control, pollination of macadamia nuts, honeybee diet and colony management, to more conceptual pure science topics, such as, mating strategies of Hymenoptera, virus infection and evolution in bees and wasps. Her diverse interests have led her to develop important cross-disciplinary collaborations with researchers and stakeholders, including bird and insect research with Dr.Brightsmith in Peru. Her knowledge of insect behavior will be critical in the development and testing of monitoring devices that allow insects to be channeled to the devices and photographed. In addition, her familiarity with the pollination needs of agricultural systems will help interpret how management activities impact pollinator diversity and abundance.


#### Katja Seltmann
***Co-PI, Director of the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration.***
Dr. Katja Seltmann's research program is in biodiversity information science and entomology, including systematics of Hymenoptera and insect ecology in coastal restoration habitats. Dr. Seltmann is PI on the Big-Bee project focused on creating 2D and 3D image libraries of bees from natural history collection specimens for computer vision applications. She will work with Dr. Villalobos on the insect pollinator portion of the grant.


#### Doug Bonham
***Collaborator, senior Electronics Engineer, Microsoft and the
founder and president of Animal Data Science LLC***
He has fifteen years of experience designing instrumentation for high profile wildlife research projects. His wildlife instrumentation projects include custom tracking and behavior logging devices for sharks, sea turtles, whales, condors, eagles, owls, sage grouse, deer, elk, bighorn sheep, beaver and marsupials. He designed novel GPS devices for Microsoft Research, and he currently manages a laboratory for high-speed communications on Surface Pro computers and dual-screen handheld devices. He was the principal electronics designer for an NSF-funded innovative hybrid GPS wildlife tracking system (NSF Award 1063364). Doug’s bird nest monitoring devices that will be used for this project are being supported by a matching grant from Microsoft’s AI for Earth program. Doug will be the lead electronics engineer for this research and will be responsible for creation of the monitoring system hardware. He will also work closely with the Software Consultant (to be hired by the project) to create the image recognition software for the monitoring devices.


#### Constance Woodman 
***Collaborator***
Constance Woodman has designed hardware, created deployment methodologies, managed data sets, and programmed data transformation software for use with her behavior loggers in wild bird cavity nests. As a senior PhD student in the Brightsmith group, she has previously managed teams of 10+ student employees for data and software tasks that track animals to complete activities for NSF I-Corps and PFI: AIR-TT funded projects (NSF Awards 1634613, 1701026). Woodman will be applying for the Project Manager position and if she is successful, she will coordinate the communications and daily operations of the project. She will also lead a team for the development of the networking of the monitoring devices and lead testing and deployments at the sites near Austin and Bigfoot, Texas.
