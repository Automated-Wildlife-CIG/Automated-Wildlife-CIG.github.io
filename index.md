### About

***Our goal is to create new, inexpensive, standardized, open-source technology that can be used to monitor insect pollinators, reptiles and amphibians, and cavity nesting bird nests.***

#### Background
Quantifying the benefit to wildlife from producers’ conservation activities is often difficult and prohibitively expensive. This limits the ability of NRCS to understand, predict, and incentivize conservation measures on privately-managed agricultural land. Technological advances in wildlife cameras, wildlife recognition software, and wireless communication make obtaining these data accessible to land managers and partners at NRCS. If deployed widely camera-based wildlife monitoring devices and accompanying software can create a database of GIS data to quantify wildlife response to conservation practices and systems on a regional scale. In this way the project proposed here addresses both local engagement with producers about conservation practices as well as landscape-scale and regional conservation goals.
Traditional wildlife monitoring data are costly to obtain and can be very difficult to use to advise landscape level management. Wildlife monitoring is extremely labor intensive and requires highly trained specialists making it very expensive (Hobson et al. 2002, Romano et al. 2017, Garden et al. 2007). Yet despite its high price tag, variations in methods and among observers make it very difficult to compare results among studies, making large scale comparisons within and among geographic regions nearly impossible (Mason et al. 2006). Interpreting wildlife monitoring data is further complicated by the fact that wildlife abundance, diversity and behavior are influenced by short- and long-term variations in weather and climate at micro scale, local, and landscape levels (Beintema 1989; Williams 1961). However, the detailed, microsite-specific climate variables that are key for interpreting variations within and among surveys are rarely available.
Traditional wildlife monitoring methods may negatively impact the wildlife species being monitored. For reptiles and amphibians (herpetofauna), traditional survey methods include drift fences with pitfall traps and turning over substrate to find hidden individuals (Corn & Bury 1990). Pitfall traps can increase the mortality through predation, exposure, and aggression among animals, while these cover object searches can stress individuals and damage the habitat (Fisher et al. 2008, Ryan et al. 2002). For insects, many sampling methods involve killing jars or similar solutions for collecting all individuals that enter the trap, which is problematic, especially for bumblebees and other declining pollinators (Nielsen et al. 2011). For nesting birds, frequent nest checks and other human disturbance can reduce reproductive success, increase adult stress levels, and may even increase predation (Major 1990, Glądalski et al. 2016).
One alternative to the more traditional wildlife monitoring techniques is the use of arrays of camera traps. These systems can be left in the field and automatically photograph animals using infrared and motion detecting triggers or take photos at regular intervals (Hobbs & Brehme 2017). Unfortunately, variation among individual cameras is high and triggers on these traditional camera traps rarely work for ectotherms, making most of these devices of little use for reptiles, amphibians, and insects (Hobbs & Brehme 2017). In addition, taking photographs at regular intervals or highly sensitive triggers create overwhelming numbers of empty photos or hours of unneeded videos (Hamel et al. 2013; Pagnucco et al. 2011). 
When camera arrays contain 10’s to 100’s of cameras, the act of traveling to change batteries and recover memory cards and organizing the data for processing is very labor intensive. Fortunately, the development of low power networking devices has created opportunities for automatic networking of field devices. The use of Long Range Radio Transmitters (LoRa) is already gaining traction in agriculture, prompting moves towards automated “smart farms” (e.g. Ramli et al. 2020; Davcev et al. 2018; Grunwald et al. 2019; Ibrahim et al. 2018; Johnson et al. 2019). Such networking of wildlife monitoring devices would greatly reduce the chance for human error, facilitate data retrieval and organization, and allow for future wireless or cellular data upload.
In response to the creation of the massive amounts of visual images from camera traps there is a growing recognition that the future of automated wildlife monitoring lies in image recognition and artificial intelligence (AI, Swinnen et al. 2014, Pegoraro et al. 2020). In this process, software automatically scans images taken against a static background to find novel items in the photos. Photos with these novel items (called “blobs” in programming) are then flagged for manual processing or automatically compared to reference images of target taxa to attempt identification (Pegoraro et al. 2020).
Unfortunately, devices using such AI software are not widely available, and the market is currently dominated by expensive devices employing proprietary technology (Pegoraro et al. 2020). As a result, this technology is being used almost exclusively by researchers, and has not become a reasonable alternative for agricultural producers managing their lands for wildlife. The wildlife monitoring industry has not created a large enough commercial market, so it is unlikely that pure market forces will drive development to the point where this technology becomes affordable enough for average producers to employ. However, if government funding facilitates the creation of freely available software tools, specifications, and data analysis environments, university researchers, hobbyists, and small wildlife tech companies will be able to create low-cost devices and provide producers options to effectively monitor wildlife on their lands.

Dr. Ethel Villalobos' expertise is ecology and behavior, having worked for over 30 years with insects, and in particular Hymenoptera. She is the lead researcher of the UH
Honeybee Project and has obtained and successfully managed over $2,000,000 in research funding from a variety of agencies including EPA, USDA-NIFA, NSF-LSAMP, as well as agricultural development grants from the Western Region agencies (WSARE, WIPM). The topics of her research range from applied systems such as fruit fly monitoring and control, pollination of macadamia nuts, honeybee diet and colony management, to more conceptual pure science topics, such as, mating strategies of Hymenoptera, virus infection and evolution in bees and wasps. Her diverse interests have led her to develop important cross-disciplinary collaborations with researchers and stakeholders, including bird and insect research with Dr.Brightsmith in Peru. Her knowledge of insect behavior will be critical in the development and testing of monitoring devices that allow insects to be channeled to the devices and photographed. In addition, her familiarity with the pollination needs of agricultural systems will help interpret how management activities impact pollinator diversity and abundance.
